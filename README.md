# The-Dice-Game


I have developed an exciting dice game that can be played by two players on a webpage using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

Each time the webpage is refreshed, a pair of dice will be rolled, resulting in random numbers.

The objective of the game is simple: the player whose dice display the highest combined value will emerge as the victorious player in that particular match.

It offers a dynamic and unpredictable gaming experience as the outcome solely depends on luck. 

With every refresh, the anticipation builds as players eagerly await their dice to reveal their fate. The element of chance adds an exhilarating touch, making each game unique and captivating.

Whether you're competing against a friend or challenging yourself, this dice game promises hours of entertainment and friendly rivalry.

So, gather your friends, load up the webpage, and let the dice roll to determine who will emerge victorious in this thrilling game of chance.

Remember, luck favors the bold, so brace yourself for the excitement and let the dice decide your fate in this gripping two-player dice game!

Do check out the link given below to see what it looks like.
